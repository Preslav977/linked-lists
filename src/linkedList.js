// Linked Lists pseudo code

// Before begin the project choose between factory functions or class syntax !

// Two important classes/factory functions that are needed.
// 1. The first one is for representing the full list
// Maybe for creating new objects (nodes) ?

// 2. Node class/factory with value property, and link to the nextNode
// set both my default.
// Hmm value property, get for reading, set for writing ?
// And this will be used to point on to the nextNode,
// something like this, previous: value, next: null ?

class LinkedList {
  // Linked List functions
  // 1. append(value) parameter, this method will add the node to the end of the list
  // Maybe check if there is tail and has any value to assign to the node's value

  headOfTheList = new Node(5);

  tailOfTheList = new Node(7);

  countNodes = 0;

  append(value) {
    // method to append node to the end of the list
    const newTail = new Node(value);
    this.countNodes += 1;
    return newTail;
  }

  // 2. prepend(value) parameter, this method will add the node
  // to the beginning of the list
  prepend(value) {
    // method to append node to the beginning of the list
    const newHead = new Node(value);
    this.countNodes += 1;
    return newHead;
  }

  // Check if the head has any value, and assign the node's value ?
  // Example 5 (head) -> 2 (tail)
  // head points to 5 (next as pointer), and the tails points to null.
  // If 1 is added as the head, 1 -> 5 -> 2
  // 1 is the new head, 1 points to 5 as next value, 2 points to null
  // If 12 is added as the tail 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 12
  // 12 is the new tail, 1 points as next value to 5, 5 next value points to 2 and 2
  // points to 12, 12 points to null

  // 3.Size, method that will return the numbers of nodes in the list
  // Maybe for loop though the whole list, and return the nodes in the current list ?
  size() {
    return this.countNodes;
    // return the number of nodes of the list
  }

  // 4. Head, method that will return the first node the first node of the list
  // Condition if the head exist such as the first node return it, no loop maybe here ?
  head() {
    // method that will return the first node of the list
    if (this.headOfTheList) {
      return this.headOfTheList;
    }
  }

  // 5. Tail, method that will return the last node of the list
  // For loop then return the tail such as the last node return it in the current list ?
  tail() {
    // method that will return the last node of the list
    if (this.tailOfTheList) {
      return this.tailOfTheList;
    }
  }

  // 6. at(index), method that will return the node of given index.
  // For loop so see in index exist in the current list such as 0,
  // if it does return the node
  at(index) {
    // method that will return node at given index
    // loop maybe for the node at the pointed index
    // next check if the node exist
    // return the node at the pointed index
    // otherwise maybe console log not found
  }

  // 7. Pop(), simple method that will remove the last node of the list.
  // pop() {
  // method that will remove the last node
  // }

  // 8. contains(value), method that will return true if the
  // exist in the list, otherwise false
  // For loop, to see if value exist return true if not false.
  // contains(value) {
  // method that will return true if the value exist otherwise false
  // }

  // 9. findValue(value), method that will return the index of the node containing
  // value null if it doesn't exist
  // For loop, if the value exist return the index of the node, else return null
  // findValue(value) {
  // method that will return the index of the node, else it will return null
  // }

  // 10. toString(), method that will represent LinkedLists objects
  // as strings in the console.
  // In the current format:
  // (value) -> (value) -> (value) -> null
  // Using JSON stringify maybe to turn these objects as strings in JSON format ?
  // toString() {
  // method that will represent the objects as strings
  // }

  /// /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Extra methods !!!
  // 11. insertAt(value, index), that will insert new node
  // with provided value of given index
  // Couple of things needs to happen here, after inserting the new node
  // the previous node
  // that has been move need to point to the new one for example
  // 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 12
  // indexes 0, 1, 2, 3
  // If 7 is added in index 2
  // 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5 - > 12
  // Two needs to points at seven, and seven has to point as 5
  // Need to somehow update the points between the nodes that has been added the new node
  // 12. removeAt(index), method that will remove node at current index.
  // If 7 is removed in the above example
  // 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 12
  // Two has to point to five, because the previous node has been removed in order to keep
  // the pointers updated, and five has to point to twelve.
  // Important tip: When you insert or remove a node, consider
  // how it will affect the existing nodes.
  // Some of the nodes will need their nextNode link updated.
