// Linked Lists pseudo code

// Before begin the project choose between factory functions or class syntax !

// Two important classes/factory functions that are needed.
// 1. The first one is for representing the full list
// Maybe for creating new objects (nodes) ?

// 2. Node class/factory with value property, and link to the nextNode
// set both my default.
// Hmm value property, get for reading, set for writing ?
// And this will be used to point on to the nextNode,
// something like this, previous: value, next: null ?
